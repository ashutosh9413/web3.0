First of all ,make a class for the description of both the cars .
then make a void function for acceleration and deceleration of car.
I considered acceleration and decelerarion only in x direction and then taken the inputs of positions , speed and accelerations of both the cars
and then runned a while loop calling the move functions of both the cars and measuring the time of collision and checking wheather collision will take place or not.
